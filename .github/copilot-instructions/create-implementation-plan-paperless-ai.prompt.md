# Paperless-AI Implementation Plan Prompt

- Structure all plans with clear phases, atomic tasks, and explicit file/function references.
- Use deterministic, machine-readable markdown (see template in main instructions).
- Include requirements, files, tests, risks, and dependencies.
- All steps must be executable autonomously by agents or humans.
